#         INTRODUCTION TO R: N°1 (WORKING PROGRESS)           #
################################################################

#This is an RScript (or script). Here we write commands/"orders" that R interprets and excutes.
#When we write something after "#" it means that is only text. This is very useful to write down your own thoughts or interpretations.

#There are some commands that are very useful in R: 
##help("command"): will give you information about the command: description, usage, arguments, details, value, references, examples, etc.

### When working with R you need to download and install packages. The packages are extenstions to the R statistical programming language that contain code, data, and dcumentation in a standardised collection format that can be installed by users of R 
#The most recommended packages are: base, compiler, datasets, grDevices, graphics, grid, methods, and others, clustger, foreign, lattice
#Also it is increasingly popular: tidyverse and ggplot2. With tidyverse you can import data, clean, transform and visualice (is one of the most downloaded R packages) 

#To install packages: 
download.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("tidyverse") #allows you to import from different formats
install.packages("manipulate")
install.packages("haven") #allows to import .dta files
install.packages("readxl") #alows to import .xls files
install.packages("logr") #allows to log/record process
install.packages("dplyr") #allows to reanme variables

### When working with R you must create a Project in which you will have all the scripts related to that project, also you need to set your working directory.
#When you set your directory, you call all your documents from that path and all your documents will be saved there.
setwd("C://Users//user//Documents//Maestría//LUND//Econometrics I//Lab1")

#You also use those paths to call data from different sources
#When importing new data you have to assigned a name to the data. Usually can be the same name of the original file, but can change according the need. 
lab1_2022 <- read_dta("C://Users//user//Documents//Maestría//LUND//Econometrics I//Lab1//lab1_2022.dta")

##R works by writing: 
#command(dataset) or 
#command(dataset$variable) or 
#command(dataset$variable, especification/option)
#Is case sensitive (its easier if al dataset and variables are in lower case)

### To EXPLORE your data in R, you can use the following commands: 
dim(lab1_2022) #dimensions of the data set: number of cases and variables
str(lab1_2022) # structure of the data 
head(lab1_2022) # first 6 rows
tail(lab1_2022) # last 6 rows
summary(lab1_2022) #if variable is continuous it will bring: min, Q1, median, mean, Q3, MAX, NA 
View(lab1_2022) # You will see the data base

#We can do the same with variables (continuous): 
summary(lab1_2022$age) #Here "summary" is the command, "lab1_2022" the dataset and "age" the variable we want to summarize

#We can also see the list of cathegorical variables: 
list(lab1_2002$var7)

###TO LOG. It is a way to record what you have done. Later, when you run many regressions or cross-tabs, it is useful to just look in yout log the results
#You need the logr package. The logr package helps create log files for R scripts. Useful when you want a written log of your program excecution

lf <- log_open (tmp) #initiates the log
log_print("hello") #print objects 
sum <- summary(lab1_2022) 
log_print(sum) #print objects
log_close() #close the log
writeLines(readLines(lf)) #view the log (the work done)

###ORDER and SORT data. Sorts(order) a vector or factor into ascending or descending order. 
#Gives as some vectors, but doesn't change the visualization of the data. 

order(lab1_2022$labor_income) #cases in ascending order 
sort(lab1_2022$labor_income, decreasing = TRUE) #income ammount in descending order
sort(lab1_2022$labor_income) #income ammount in ascending order (by default)

#We can search for specific cases
list(lab1_2022$var7[35])
kids <- lab1_2022$wife_present==0
table(kids)

###TO TABULATE 
table(lab1_2022$wife_present)
table(lab1_2022$labor_income, lab1_2022$wife_present)
table(lab1_2022$education, lab1_2022$nr_of_kids)

###TO RENAME VARIABLES AND CREATE LABELS
#Dataset from other sources can be ambiguos or inconvenient, so it is useful to rename them into something easily to interpret
